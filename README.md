## Data Cleaning and Analysis of the Archigos: A Data Set on Leaders 1875-2015 Version 4.1

This is an EDA of the Archigos 4.1 dataset, which covers political leader transitions from 1875 - 2015. In this data set, I was interested in the relationship between how a leader entered power (election, war, coup, etc.) and how they left power (peacefully, war, coup etc.).

## Motivation 
I am developing data cleaning and analytic skills with conflict data to answer public focusd questions. 

## Technologies 
Python 3.7
